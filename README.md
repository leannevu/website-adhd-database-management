# website-adhd-database-management
Inspired from my adhd body double application, I wanted to turn it into a website that I locally host. The website connects to my locally hosted database as well. It has the same use cases as my body-double application using Java on Netbeans, except this time I used my new HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and Jquery/AJAX skills to turn it into a website! 

I also included a file that includes the adhd database schema and insert statements that were used on my website.
